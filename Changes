Revision history for Router-Statistics
0.99_6	15/1/2007
	Fixed the CPE key cycling code ( again and it now works , I promise ) and added
	an example into the examples directory on how it works.
	Started to add 'DEBUG' references into the code.
0.99	9/1/2007
	Added the option for 'enable' password for telnet command ( currently only stm )
	however will be making 'generic' attributes for username/password and enable
	password per UBR in a future release.
	Fixed UBR_get_DOCSIS_interface_information_Blocking which did not work as expected
	Updated Get_UBR_inventory with cpu_type, ios_version and chassis type.
	This function and all other non prefixed UBR functions will be changes to UBR_xx
	before release of version 1.x
0.98	19/12/2006
	Finished CPE SNMP key cycler, so different CPE can now have different
	SNMP keys and the CPE_Test_Connection function will try and determine
	which one to use. SNMP keys should be supplied comma seperated 
	ie. public,private,mykey and the code will use them in order to determine
	which one is correct.
	Added some more text for the help section (although not brilliant)
	Added different router type inventory functions, 7500, 7600(6500) and GSR
0.97	3/12/2006
	Added into the OID module the telnet command set and tidied the
	STM gather code a little.
0.96	2/12/2006
	Added Telnet ( eekkk panic and run away quickly ) to allow correct
	STM statistics to be collected from routers. It looks like this is 
	heading down a dangerous path, however I DO NOT intend to use Telnet
	for anything else.
0.95	1/12/2006
	Added some basic man entries for the module , after a little feedback
	many more yet to come.
0.94	1/12/2006
	The development server had the wrong time, causing install failures for
	certain systems. This is now fixed ( ntpdate is useful ).
0.93	29/11/2006
	Added Blocking mirrors to all functions and some tidy up of code
0.92	28/11/2006
	Alot of tidying has occured and function listing for the documentation
0.91    27/11/2006
        First version, semi alpha release, used extensively in the real world
	but as yet not tidy enough for a full public release
