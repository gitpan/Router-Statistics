Revision history for Router-Statistics
0.99_981 11/01/2008
	Fixed up some of the dubious coding that has crept in.

	Ripped out all the DOCSIS1.1/3 service flow code.

0.99_980 21/12/2007
	Fixed some Blocking functions to be comparable to non blocking
	Added Router 'alive' check after STM Blocking has polled a router
	Added single mac change for DOCSIS1.0 speeds ( Cisco only )
	Added DOCSIS1.1/DOCSIS3 service flow capture by MAC
		Added capture all devices, flow speeds, and usage, packets/octets
		Added capture for specific MAC address
		Service flow information is 32 bit (arrgg!!)
	Added the need for some IO modules in preparation to adding IPDR support
0.99_978 20/12/2007
	Modified the STM polling code.
	Now the STM gather code gets the STM profiles and their definitions to determine
	if the the router should be polled. NTP *MUST* be configured on the router so that
	the time the UBR thinks it is can be checked against the STM window.
0.99_977 17/12/2007
	Added DOCSIS modulation profiles.
0.99_95	15/12/2007
	Started to add service flow, DOCSIS 1.1/2/3, information
0.99_94	10/9/2007
	Fixed some OID entries in the OID.pm
0.99_93	3/4/2007
	Cleaned up some code.
0.99_92 31/3/2007
	Added in the module telnet to default to return, not die. Previously any wrapper
	script was setting this, but has caused some confusion why certain scripts
	failed and otherS returned normally.
0.99_91	27/3/2007
	Added access to the format modifier for STM output and changed the default to
	include year.
0.99_9  5/2/2007
	Downstream modulation type incorrect. Offset of array incorrect causing
	incorrect modulations to be transformed.
0.99_8	1/2/2007
	Added in frequency OIDs for STB/CMs into OID.pm
0.99_7	30/1/2007
	Small bug in the QOSPROFILE return for the ifPersist configuration bug.
0.99_6	15/1/2007
	Fixed the CPE key cycling code ( again and it now works , I promise ) and added
	an example into the examples directory on how it works.
	Started to add 'DEBUG' references into the code.
0.99	9/1/2007
	Added the option for 'enable' password for telnet command ( currently only stm )
	however will be making 'generic' attributes for username/password and enable
	password per UBR in a future release.
	Fixed UBR_get_DOCSIS_interface_information_Blocking which did not work as expected
	Updated Get_UBR_inventory with cpu_type, ios_version and chassis type.
	This function and all other non prefixed UBR functions will be changes to UBR_xx
	before release of version 1.x
0.98	19/12/2006
	Finished CPE SNMP key cycler, so different CPE can now have different
	SNMP keys and the CPE_Test_Connection function will try and determine
	which one to use. SNMP keys should be supplied comma seperated 
	ie. public,private,mykey and the code will use them in order to determine
	which one is correct.
	Added some more text for the help section (although not brilliant)
	Added different router type inventory functions, 7500, 7600(6500) and GSR
0.97	3/12/2006
	Added into the OID module the telnet command set and tidied the
	STM gather code a little.
0.96	2/12/2006
	Added Telnet ( eekkk panic and run away quickly ) to allow correct
	STM statistics to be collected from routers. It looks like this is 
	heading down a dangerous path, however I DO NOT intend to use Telnet
	for anything else.
0.95	1/12/2006
	Added some basic man entries for the module , after a little feedback
	many more yet to come.
0.94	1/12/2006
	The development server had the wrong time, causing install failures for
	certain systems. This is now fixed ( ntpdate is useful ).
0.93	29/11/2006
	Added Blocking mirrors to all functions and some tidy up of code
0.92	28/11/2006
	Alot of tidying has occured and function listing for the documentation
0.91    27/11/2006
        First version, semi alpha release, used extensively in the real world
	but as yet not tidy enough for a full public release
